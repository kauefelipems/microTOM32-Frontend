# microTOM32-Frontend
Firmware for µTOM32 EIT Board. Still need several adjustments. Updates from the previous µTOM32 board:
- Increased channel count (up to 32 channels)
- Current measurement
- Embedded FFT modulus measurements to improve speed
- Two gain control signals for the VGA (V1: DB gain, V2: Linear Gain - Refer to the Datasheet)

In the repository you will also find:

- A PyEIT example for interface with the board (require PyEIT library installed)
- µTOM32 board schematics for reference

WARNING: This is NOT a "plug and play" device, it is a preliminary version that requires debugging, characterization and (probably) corrections!
